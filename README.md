# burlo_mon
Monitor Program for 6502 systems (Hobby!)

It is assembled with the acme cross assembler: https://web.archive.org/web/20150520143433/https://www.esw-heim.tu-clausthal.de/~marco/smorbrod/acme/

It runs on the burlington 6502 emulator (https://github.com/kgodden/burlington).

It doesn't do much yet, just prints out memory and register status...
